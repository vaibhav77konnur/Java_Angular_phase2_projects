<h2>Task Management System (TMS)</h2>

Overview

The Task Management System (TMS) is a command-line application built using TypeScript that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. It follows the Object-Oriented Approach (OOA) with modules and classes to structure the code properly. Users can create, view, mark tasks as complete, and delete them interactively.

<h2>Features</h2>

Add a Task: Create a new task with a title and description.

View All Tasks: Display a list of all tasks along with their completion status.

Mark a Task as Complete: Update the status of a task when finished.

Exit the Program: Close the task manager.

<h2>Example Output</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Welcome to Task Manager!</li>
    <li>1. Add Task</li>
